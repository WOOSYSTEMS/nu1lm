Protocol:
1. Add sample to density solution
2. Stir/shake vigorously
3. Allow settling (2-24 hours)
4. Collect supernatant
5. Repeat 2-3 times
6. Filter through appropriate mesh

3. ORGANIC MATTER REMOVAL
Critical for spectroscopic analysis

Methods:
- H₂O₂ (30%): 24-48h at 50-60°C (gentle)
- Fenton's reagent (H₂O₂ + Fe): faster, more aggressive
- KOH (10%): good for biota, attacks some plastics
- HNO₃: aggressive, may damage plastics
- Enzymatic: specific, gentle, expensive

Recommended:
- 30% H₂O₂ at 50°C for 24-48h
- Repeat until solution clear
- Works well with wet peroxide oxidation (WPO)

4. FILTRATION
